## Chapter 1: LANs Technology – Switched LANs

### key words

- LANs technology

  - Share media LANs

    > (==Layer 1==)using ==Hubs==,which transmit frames in ==half-duplex== mode

  - Switched LANs

    > (==Layer 2==)using ==Switches==,which transmit frames in ==full-duplex== mode

  - Switch features

    - Application-specific integrated circuit(==ASICs==)
    - Small form-factor pluggable(==SFP==)
    - Power of Ethernet(==PoE==)

  - switched virtual interface(==SVI==)

    > the virtual interface configuring the IP address

  - ==Redundant switched LANs==

    > Layer 2 redundancy allows networks to be fault tolerant by having multiple paths for data to traverse the network.
    >
    > it may cause:
    >
    > - ==broadcast storm==,
    > - ==multiple unicast frame transmissions==
    > - ==MAC address table instability==

  - layer 2 loop(==switching loop==)

  - spanning-tree protocol(==STP==)

    > is a ==layer 2== protocol , defined in ==IEEE 802.1D==

    - Bridge protocol Data Units(==BPDUs==)

      > The STP requires all switches to exchange messages to detect the switching loops and to create a loop free logical topology.
      >
      > by default, BPDUs are sent out ==every two seconds==

    - ==Root bridge==(a root node) && ==Non-root bridge==

    - ==Root ports== && ==Designated ports==

      > are used for ==forwarding the traffic==

    - ==Non-designated ports==

      > used for ==blocking the traffic==

    - BID

    - Port ID

    - extended system ID

    - Path Cost
